# Info
These scripts are from one of the modules I'm taking this semester, SM-2302 Software for Mathematicians (webpage: [GH Pages](https://sm2302.github.io)/[Normal](https://github.com/sm2302)). None of these are from graded coursework. Other than MATLAB, we also get introduced to:
- R (statistical computations)
- Git (version control), and
- $LaTeX$ (typesetting of formal documents)
